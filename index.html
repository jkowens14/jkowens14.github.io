                <hr>
                <p>Hello! My name is Jacob Owens and welcome to my personal website designed entirely by me. I am a native of Indianapolis,
                    Indiana. I earned a BA in Psychology from Wabash College in 2014 and for the past six years I 
                    worked for the United States Postal Service. I enjoy learning new things and solving problems. I have built 
                    a few desktop computers for myself and also manage my own home network. I enjoy working with computers 
                    and am currently trying to transition into a career in Information Technology. I also have experience with programming and 
                    am actively learning more skills and techniques every day.

                    <p>
                        One of my favorite things to do is to travel around the country and go camping.
                        I have been to the Rocky Mountains, Grand Canyon (pictured above), Mount Rushmore, and
                        Badlands
                        National Park. I would very much like to go out to the west coast and see the Pacific
                        Northwest.

                        <p>
                            I am a member of the <a class="gaa-link" href="https://indygaa.com/about/"
                                target="_blank">Indianapolis GAA</a>
                            and
                            spend a lot of my free time in the summer playing the traditional Irish sports of Gaelic
                            football and hurling. The Indy GAA also has
                            indoor leagues in the Winter to help keep the skills of the games sharp while keeping in
                            touch
                            with each other.

                        <p>
                            I also enjoy playing video games in my free time. I mostly play League of Legends and
                            Rocket
                            League.
                            When I started
                            playing Rocket League in 2019 I was ranked Platinum. In 2020 I made it to high Diamond.
                            I
                            made
                            it a
                            goal to rank up to Champion
                            in 2021. I am happy to say that I have acheived that goal! Now, it's on to Grand
                            Champion in
                            2022.
